# confocal-microscopy-ray-tracing-of-spherical-caps
Mathematica 14 code to simulate imaging of spherical caps using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The code generates a raster scanned confocal image for a given contact angle, objective numerical aperture, and refractive index of the spherical cap and its surrounding environment. Code is directly associated with https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0253522, whose pdf is found in this repository with file name 'JCP-Intrinsic-hydrophobicity-of IDP-based-biomolecular-condensates-drives-their-partial-drying-on-membrane-surfaces.pdf'.
