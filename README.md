# confocal-microscopy-ray-tracing-of-spherical-caps
Mathematica 14 notebook used to simulate imaging of spherical caps using fluorescence confocal microscopy. 

# Description

The notebook generates a raster scanned confocal image for a given contact angle, objective numerical aperture, and refractive index of the spherical cap and its surrounding environment.
