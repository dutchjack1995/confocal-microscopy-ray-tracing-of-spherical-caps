# confocal-microscopy-ray-tracing-of-spherical-caps
Mathematica code to simulate imaging of spherical caps using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The code generates a raster scanned confocal image for a given contact angle, objective numerical aperture, and refractive index of the spherical cap and its surrounding environment. Code is directly associated with https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0253522.
